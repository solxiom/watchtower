# Review Batch RT-09 — Task catalog, lane profile, and aggregate contracts

Status: ⏳ Awaiting independent review
Paired work brief: `work-batches/RT-09-task-catalog-lane-profile-and-aggregate-contracts.md`
Depends on accepted evidence from: RT-01, RM-11

## Independent proof and verdict

Review the real diff, source, tests, artifacts, and report. Verify exclusive
ownership of capability fragments, aggregate generator, catalog/profile contracts and independently prove: Duplicate/dangling/stale rejection; profile cannot add code/tasks; deterministic aggregate. Test negative,
stale/corrupt, path/state/replay, read-only/effect, and relocation boundaries.
Reproduce Nirvana/NVB audits, public artifact synchronization, size/cohesion
evidence, focused tests, build/test/dist proof, Git hygiene, and the complete
engineering acceptance matrix.

Do not repair implementation. Any failed gate rejects. Emit exactly one
durable `accept`, `reject`, or `skip`; only the reviewer may create the
acceptance commit, separately from publication.
