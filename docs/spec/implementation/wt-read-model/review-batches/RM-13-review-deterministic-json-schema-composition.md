# Review Batch RM-13 — Deterministic JSON Schema composition

Status: ⏳ Awaiting independent review
Paired work brief: `work-batches/RM-13-deterministic-json-schema-composition.md`
Depends on accepted evidence from: RM-01

## Independent proof and verdict

Review the real diff, source, tests, artifacts, and report. Verify exclusive
ownership of schema fragments, composer, aggregate stale gate and independently prove: Duplicate $defs, unresolved $ref, root-conflict rejection; byte-identical regeneration. Test negative,
stale/corrupt, path/state/replay, read-only/effect, and relocation boundaries.
Reproduce Nirvana/NVB audits, public artifact synchronization, size/cohesion
evidence, focused tests, build/test/dist proof, Git hygiene, and the complete
engineering acceptance matrix.

Do not repair implementation. Any failed gate rejects. Emit exactly one
durable `accept`, `reject`, or `skip`; only the reviewer may create the
acceptance commit, separately from publication.
